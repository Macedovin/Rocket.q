## About

Project developed as a result of the teachings learned at NLW - Next Level Week 6, "Trilha Discover", a Rocketseat event.

A full application, with Frontend and Backend, that allows you to receive anonymous questions in different rooms (you can divide them by themes, for example) as well as good management possibilities of these questions.
